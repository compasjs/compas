# Release notes v0.0.171

Another release packed with a bunch of dependency updates, fixes and of course
some features. Although we have some breaking changes. That is not the major
reason for these release notes. Read on to check what it is.

## The small changes

- AppError#format know supports formatting all kinds of primitives in addition
  to Error and AppError instances. This is useful when an underlying library
  throws a string instead of an Error.
- We enabled running Compas tests on Node.js 17. In the near future we will also
  run our lint & benchmarks on Node.js 17. Note that even though we run our
  tests there, it is not officially supported.
- Code generators now print out an error if `enabledGroups` contain a group that
  is not included in the known structure. This can help spot typo's or left over
  artifacts.
- Include a React import in the `common/reactQuries.tsx` file, this isn't used
  but required in some environments.

## The breaking changes

Let's start with a breaking change in the way uploaded files are represented in
the backend. We updated Formidable to `2.0.1` after being on a canary version
for too long. This introduced some property renames:

- `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.path` -> `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.filepath`
- `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.name` -> `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.originalFilename`
- `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.type` -> `ctx.validatedFiles.xxx.mimetype`

The easiest way to update these changes, is to globally search for
`ctx.validatedFiles` and trace your usages from there. Note that you also need
to regenerate this the validator know also checks on these new properties.

The second breaking change has to do with the `AbortSignal` and support for it
in Axios & react-query. All api client functions now optionally accept a partial
`AxiosRequestConfig`, currently limited to `signal`, that is passed to Axios
directly. This also affects the generated react-query based hooks. Luckily for
us, react-query now supports creating an `AbortSignal` for us in the `queryFn`,
so we use that to provide to the api client functions. This also means that we
don't have to add `cancelToken` to the `UseQueryOptions`, so that is removed as
well.

## The features

After already having a way to extend a Compas structure with an imported OpenAPI
specification via `app.extendWithOpenApi`. It is now possible to convert a
Compas structure as to the OpenAPI v3.0.3 specification. Currently, the minimal
set is implemented to create a correct and complete definition (with most Compas
features covered). Later on, we want to extend the exporter with more OpenAPI
specific features (e.g. security methods/tags per endpoints, base urls, various
http schema's, etc.), but those need more configuration (within projects) and
most likely vary a lot between project implementations.

As said before most Compas types are implemented, such as:

- HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Params, Query, Body and Response types
  - References are hoisted to OpenAPI component objects
  - Including file upload and download support
- Spec information:
  - Title, version, description
- Pass-through settings (for now only `servers`)
- Compas groups
  - When no groups provided all groups within the `inputPath` structure are
    exposed
  - When a type is referenced but not part of one of the `enabledGroups`, the
    reference is resolved and included in the output. This is the same behaviour
    as all other `generate` calls that accept an `enabledGroups` option.

To enable this feature, the following code snippet could be applied:

```js
// new or existing App instance
const app = new App({ verbose: true });

await app.generateOpenApi({
  // Path that is previously used as `outputDirectory`
  inputPath: "./src/generated",
  outputFile: "./docs/openapi.json",
  enabledGroups: ["exampleGroup"],
  openApiOptions: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    title: "Title of specification",
    description: "Lorem Ipsum",
    servers: [
      {
        url: "https://locationToApi",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

This will write the OpenAPI based specification to `docs/openapi.json`. To
expose this file via a custom route, you can use something like:

```js
// gen
R.get("/docs/openapi", "docsOpenAPI").response({ spec: T.any() });

// src
const openapiSpec = JSON.parse(
  await readFile(pathJoin(process.cwd(), "docs/openapi.json"), "utf-8"),
);

groupHandeler.docsOpenAPI = async (ctx, next) => {
  ctx.body = { spec: openapiSpec };

  return next();
};
```

## In closing

We are now able to import & export & import OpenAPI specs again and again. We
hope you use this feature wisely ;) The next release, if we don't need a bug fix
release (A), is going to contain JWT based sessions backed by @compas/store. If
you have any usages not covered by the current sessions and want Compas to
support them, please add it to
[Issue 1280](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/issues/1280) and if you are
curious what the new implementation looks like, feel free to check out out the
[PR](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/pull/1302).
