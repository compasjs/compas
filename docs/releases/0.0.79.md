# Release notes v0.0.79

The first time we actually have release notes. I guess it is a start in making
LBU a bit more mature. Remember when you had to search through all PR's cause
something was broken in a new release? Yea, I do ;P Let's get to the juicy
details.

### Chores

We have updated Postgres twice to a new minor versions of `2.0.0-beta`. Although
the package doesn't have clear goal for what the `2.0.0` release should contain,
we don't have to step up there or look for alternatives yet. Other than that,
some minor things like automatically linking these release notes in the
generated changelog, switching the default branch to `main` and fixing up the
dependabot config.

### Cli

In our test runner we now warn when a subtest uses an assertion on the parent
`t`. This prevents confusion when a failing assertion is printed under the
parent, instead of the subtest.

```js
import { mainTestFn, test } from "@compas/cli";

mainTestFn(import.meta);

test("My test", (t) => {
  t.test("sub test", () => {
    // warning: called 't.ok' on parent 't'. Accept 't' as argument in the callback of 't.test(msg, callback)'.
    t.ok(true);
  });
});
```

This caught a single usage in the lbu codebase
[here](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/blob/fba1ffe00a9f6dc43ed75c521f62eb9a9fb2c985/packages/stdlib/src/lodash.test.js#L112)
.

### Code gen

Since we actively used the open-api importer for the first time,
[@tjonger](https://github.com/tjonger) found and fixed various bugs in there.
Notably, resolving references in path and query parameters and creating a name
from the path if `operationId` is not available.

Other than that we have two new features, soft deletes for sql generation and
cancel token support in apiClient and react-query hook generation. Let's start
with the latter.

We added support for request cancellation with
[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#cancellation). To minimize the
differences between the api client generated when `isNode` is used versus
`isBrowser`, most of the logic is done in the generated hooks. We accept the
property `cancelToken` on the `options` argument, which is the `QueryConfig`
provided to `useQuery`. If provided, the `cancelToken#token` is passed through
to the generated api client function, and the `cancelToken#cancel` function is
added to the returned Promise. This is behaviour is mostly in line with
[react-query documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/query-cancellation#using-axios).

```tsx
import { CancelToken, CancelTokenSource } from "axios";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // I don't know React, please provide better sample :S
  const cancelToken = useMemo(() => CancelToken.source(), [count]);

  // Expensive operation
  const { data: imageBlob } = useAppConvertCountToImage(
    { count },
    { cancelToken },
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <img src={URL.createObjectURL(imageBlob)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

The other big thing is soft delete support in sql generation. This can be
enabled by passing in `withSoftDeletes: true` in `enableQueries` calls. This
takes over the old `withHistory`, and immediately removed support. Soft deletes
add a `deletedAt` column. All generated `where` arguments by default won't
return 'deleted' records. This can be enabled by providing
`{ deletedAtInclude: true }`. To permanently delete a record,
`groupQueries.tableDeletePermanent` is generated as well.

```js
// In generate
const T = new TypeCreator();
app.add(
  T.object("myValue")
    .keys({
      id: T.uuid().primary(),
      count: T.number(),
    })
    .enableQueries({ withSoftDeletes: true }),
);

// Insert a record
const [myValue] = await appQueries.myValueInsert(sql, { count: 5 });

const firstCount = await appQueries.myValueCount(sql);
// firstCount === 1

// Delete our `myValue`
await appQueries.myValueDelete(sql, { id: myValue.id });

const secondCount = await appQueries.myValueCount(sql);
// secondCount === 0, deleted records are not included

const countWithDeleted = await appQueries.myValueCount(sql, {
  deletedAtInclude: true,
});
// countWithDeleted === 1

// Remove record completely
await appQueries.myValueDeletePermanent(sql, { id: myValue.id });
```

Note that cascading soft deletes is not included in this release. The generated
DDL, enabled by `app.generate({ ..., dumpPostgres: true })` does not yet
interact with `withSoftDeletes`. For an example of how to use it manually see
the open [issue](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/issues/342)

### Store

This package seems to have the most breaking changes. We renamed all table names
to use singular nouns:

- `migrations` -> `migration`
- `fileStore` -> `file` -> `storeQueries.fileSelect`
- `sessionStore` -> `session` -> `storeQueries.sessionSelect`
- `jobQueue` -> `job` -> `storeQueries.jobSelect`

File now uses the `withSoftDeletes` instead of `withHistory`. This means that
the `syncDeletedFiles` function will only clean up 'permanently' deleted files.
We also renamed `file#filename` to `file#name`.

`getMigrationsToBeApplied` from the migration part of `@lbu/store`, will also
return a list of migrations that have changed since they are applied to the
database. This allows you to communicate to other developers that some
migrations have changed and that they may need to do a full database reset.

##### In closing

As it is the first time doing this, I did not expect it to take this much time.
Any constructive feedback to the writing style, background information provided
or other questions are welcome.

That's all!
