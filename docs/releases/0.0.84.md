# Release notes v0.0.84

This release contains some small fixes and features compared to the previous
release. We also enabled tests and benchmarks in CI for the newly released
Node.js 15!

### Code gen

In preparation for structure stability we do loose validation of the structure
to generate for. This enables us to add new fields in releases without breaking
the generators of previous releases.

A small feature added to the route builder is support for 'PATCH' requests. Lbu
still prefers to use 'PUT' by convention, but this allows a wider range of
OpenAPI specs to be imported.

We also have a few fixes for the previous release. The structure is now
correctly dumped. In lbu 0.0.83 we didn't nest groups in the `structure` export
from `structure.js`. And sql `in` and `notIn` in the generated were clause
should use the correct sql types now, even when the field is an reference.

Lastly support is added for `app.addRelations(reference, ...relations)`. LBU
requires that both sides of a relation are registered, but that wasn't possible
without a hack:

```js
import { storeStructure } from "./generated/index.js";
import { App, TypeCreator } from "@lbu/code-gen";

const app = await App.new();
const T = new TypeCreator();

app.add(
  T.object("myEntity")
    .keys({})
    .relations(T.manyToOne("file", T.reference("store", "file"), "entities")),
);

storeStructure.store.file.relations.push(
  T.oneToMany("entities", T.reference("app", "myEntity")),
);
```

While the new variant looks a bit cleaner:

```js
import { App, TypeCreator } from "@lbu/code-gen";

const app = await App.new();
const T = new TypeCreator();

app.add(
  T.object("myEntity")
    .keys({})
    .relations(T.manyToOne("file", T.reference("store", "file"), "entities")),
);

app.addRelations(
  T.reference("store", "file"),
  T.oneToMany("entities", T.reference("app", "myEntity")),
);
```

### Server

We don't log the event call stack anymore for 'OPTIONS' requests. This is done
to keep the logs a bit cleaner.

### In closing

That's all for now. Have fun!
