# Release notes v0.0.103

Another big release, another set of release notes. Usually that means there are
some breaking changes, as is the case with v0.0.103. This release notes are a
bit different tho, we only have changes to the code-gen package and thus will
have separate sub headers for each feature instead of per package.

##### Stable validator output

Previously, if you introduced a new type somewhere, all anonymous validators
would get a different name. This was simply based on an increasing number, where
a unique type would get a new number and thus created function names like
`anonymousValidator3`. Now we create a hash based on the type and use that when
naming anonymous validators. This results in git diffs being easier to read. The
new anonymous validator names will look something like
`anonymousValidator781180217`.

##### Any Validators

We now have support for custom validators for `T.any()` types. These should
return a boolean value, and don't have to worry about nullability. A simple
example:

```js
// generate.js

const T = new TypeCreator();
app.add(
  T.any().raw("{ myType: true }").validator("myValidator", {
    javaScript: 'import { myValidator } from "./dist/custom-validators.js";',
    typeScript: 'import { myValidator } from "./src/custom-validators.ts";',
  }),
);
```

```ts
// src/custom-validator.js

type MyType = { myType: true };

function isMyType(value): value is MyType {
  return value?.myType === true;
}
```

This way you can even reuse you custom validator as a TypeScript type-guard.

##### Inline validators

To improve performance and reduce call stacks, we introduce inline validators.
This is a fully backwards compatible change. For now only a few cases will be
inlined, for example any types, booleans, string oneOf and references. There is
a trade-off here between re-usability and decreasing callstacks. So we are not
sure yet how far this will go and if we should find a better way of doing it.

##### Simplified strict object validation

In your anonymous-validator file, you will now find all static keys of the
objects that are validated in strict mode. Instead of allocating a Set every
validation call, we now reuse this set, and do the strict check first. This is
inspired by the key checks done in the generated `UPDATE` and `INSERT` query
partials.

##### SQL Query builders

The biggest feature of this release is nested sql query builders. It solves a
few things in one go:

- Get nested results from Postgres
- Transform results in usable JavaScript objects, converting Dates back and
  removing nulls
- Includes the old traverse builder

There are still lots of missing features and some limitations:

- Offset and limit are not supported in nested builders yet
- Generated transformers don't work with recursive types
- Transformers only work correctly nested with a valid builder object. This will
  most likely always be the case.

Note that we have enabled the transformers for the basic queries as well, and
thus you'd be able to directly benefit from it without having to use a nested
query.

##### SQL Where and query builder argument validation

We have removed the custom key check from generated Where partials, and now use
full validator features. This requires the validator generator to be enabled
when the sql generator is used. This is possible due to the custom any
validators and some internal reordering in the generators.

##### SQL Where or support

The last small, but darn useful feature is `OR` support in the generated Where
partials. The new where-objects now accept an `$or` key with an array of nested
where-objects. This allows for any recursing `OR` and `AND` combination
necessary.

### In closing

A big release since a while, some breaking changes, mostly subtle. One of the
last ones before a rename and public release. I already have some names in mind,
but any suggestions are welcome.
