# Getting started

Let's start by checking the system and project requirements;

- Running macOS or any Linux based OS
- Node.js v16 or higher installed
- Yarn v1 installed (TODO: migrate this to Yarn v3 / NPM latest)
- Using ES Modules by adding `{ type: "module" }` in your package.json

To add Compas to your project, install the following most used packages:

```shell
yarn add -D -E @compas/cli
yarn add -E @compas/stdlib
```

Let's explore Compas starting with the [CLI](/features/cli.md)
