# Getting started

Let's start by checking the system and project requirements;

- Running macOS or any Linux based OS
- Node.js v16 or higher installed
- Yarn or NPM installed
- Using ES Modules by adding `{ type: "module" }` in your package.json

To add Compas to your project, install the following most used packages:

```shell
yarn add --exact @compas/cli @compas/stdlib
# OR
npm add --save-exact @compas/cli @compas/stdlib
```

Let's explore Compas starting with the [CLI](/features/cli.md)
