## Migration files

Compas cli comes with a migration runner built-in. This is based on various
migration functions exported from @compas/store. The migration system supports
two types of migrations:

- Forward migrations
- Repeatable migrations

Forward migrations are a way of only advancing the schema state. So when you
need to rollback a change, a new forward migration needs to be created.

Repeatable migrations can be used in combination with `CREATE OR REPLACE` with
for example views. If the hash of the current repeatable migration is not equal
to the last execution stored in the database, the migration is executed.

Every migration file gets a new transaction by default. To skip transaction
creation, add `-- disable auto transaction` in your file.

The migrations files are expected to live in `$project/migrations` directory.
The file names should be in the following format: `001-name.sql` or
`002-r-long-name.sql` for repeatable migrations.

We also support JavaScript based migrations, this allows you to do conditional
logic based on environment settings. A JavaScript migration file follows the
same file format as sql files: `002-my-js-migration.js`. To disable automatic
transactions you can use `// disable auto transaction` anywhere in the file.

The file is imported by the migration runner and expected to export the
following migration function:

```js
export async function migrate(sql) {
  // Do migrations
}
```

Note that it is suggested to keep the amount of differences per environment to a
minimal, since it makes issues harder to debug.

See the CLI reference for
[`compas migrate`](/references/cli.html#compas-migrate) for the build-in
migration runner.
