# Code generator CRUD

Compas code-gen also supports generating CRUD routes. It combines the features
of the [api generator](/features/code-gen-api-client.html),
[sql generator](/features/code-gen-sql.html) and a generated implementation of
the necessary events.

::: tip

Requires `@compas/cli`, `@compas/stdlib`, `@compas/store` and `@compas/code-gen`
to be installed.

## The features

CRUD generation supports quiet a variety of features and combinations there of.
Let's break them all down;

### Route selection:

Any CRUD declaration fully controls which routes are generated, by explicitly
enabling them.

```js
const T = new TypeCreator("tag");
const Tdatabase = new TypeCreator("database");

Tdatabase.object("tag")
  .keys({
    key: T.string().searchable().trim().min(3),
    value: T.string(),
  })
  .enableQueries({
    withDates: true,
  });

T.crud("/tag").entity(T.reference("database", "tag")).routes({
  listRoute: true,
  singleRoute: true,
  createRoute: true,
  updateRoute: true,
  deleteRoute: true,
});
```

Combining all options, it generates the following routes;

- `apiTagList` / `/tag/list`
- `apiTagSingle` / `/tag/:tagId/single`
- `apiTagCreate` / `/tag/create`
- `apiTagUpdate` / `/tag/:tagId/update`
- `apiTagDelete` / `/tag/:tagId/delete`

### Filters, sorting and pagination:

The generated `list` route comes fully equipped with filters, sorting and
pagination. The filters are a subset of the filters as supported by the query
builder, ie ignoring `$raw` and `$or` to prevent SQL injection and too complex
filters respectively. Sorting is also based on the current query builder
behaviour where you specify the columns to be sorted on in `orderBy` and a
seperated `orderBySpec` to determine the sort order for that column. And finally
pagination is supported via the `offset` and `limit` params.

### Inline relations

The CRUD generator can also include inline relations in the response, but also
allow creating and updating them via their respective routes. This works for
both `oneToMany` relations as for the referenced side of an `oneToOne` relation.
These inline relations can be added via `.inlineRelations()` like the following;

```js
const T = new TypeCreator("post");
const Tdatabase = new TypeCreator("database");

Tdatabase.object("post")
  .keys({
    title: T.string().searchable(),
  })
  .enableQueries({
    withDates: true,
  })
  .relations(T.oneToMany("tags", T.reference("database", "tag")));

Tdatabase.object("tag")
  .keys({
    key: T.string().searchable().trim().min(3),
    value: T.string(),
  })
  .enableQueries({
    withDates: true,
  })
  .relations(T.manyToOne("post", T.reference("database", "post"), "tags"));

T.crud("/post")
  .entity(T.reference("database", "post"))
  .routes({
    listRoute: true,
    createRoute: true,
    updateRoute: true,
  })
  .inlineRelations(T.crud().fromParent("tags", { name: "tag" }));
```

The above generates approximately the following type for both the read routes,
like `apiPostList`, as well as for the write routes like `apiPostCrete` and
`apiPostUpdate`.

```
type PostItem = {
  id: string;
  title: string,
  tags: { id: string, key: string, value: string }[]
}
```

When updating an inline relation, all existing values are first removed, before
the new values are added. `oneToOne` relations are mandatory by default, but can
be made optional via `T.crud().fromParent(...).optional()`. Inline relations can
be nested as many times as required.

### Nested relations

The same thing as above can be done but now with `.nestedRelations`. This
creates a nested route structure.

```js
// Using the same Post -> tags[] relation like above

T.crud("/post")
  .entity(T.reference("database", "post"))
  .routes({
    listRoute: true,
    singleRoute: true,
    createRoute: true,
    updateRoute: true,
    deleteRoute: true,
  })
  .nestedRelations(
    T.crud("/tag").fromParent("tags", { name: "tag" }).routes({
      // Routes need to be enabled
      listRoute: true,
      singleRoute: true,
      createRoute: true,
      updateRoute: true,
      deleteRoute: true,
    }),
  );
```

This generates the following routes:

- `apiPostList` / `/post/list`
- `apiPostSingle` / `/post/:postId/single`
- `apiPostCreate` / `/post/create`
- `apiPostUpdate` / `/post/:postId/update`
- `apiPostDelete` / `/post/:postId/delete`
- `apiPostTagList` / `/post/:postId/taglist`
- `apiPostTagSingle` / `/post/:postId/tag/:tagId/single`
- `apiPostTagCreate` / `/post/:postId/tag/create`
- `apiPostTagUpdate` / `/post/:postId/tag/:tagId/update`
- `apiPostTagDelete` / `/post/:postId/tag/:tagId/delete`

Appropriate route invalidations for react-query generator are automatically
added in all cases. In case a nested relation is used with a `oneToOne`
relation, the `list` route is automatically disabled, and the extra route params
are removed.

### Modifiers

While calling `groupRegisterCrud` from the generated `crud.js` you can pass in
various 'modifiers'. These modifiers are all optional and can mutate the passed
in context, resolve a user, determine access control and edit the provided
'builders'. They are called after the static validation of params, query and
body, but before executing any other logic.

All modifier functions can be async, getting an `event` as the first argument
and the request `ctx` as the second. The `single`, `update` and `delete` routes
also provide the used `builder` as the third argument. This way you can mutate
the executed where clause to prevent unauthorized access.

The `list` route modifier passes in a `countBuilder` and a `listBuilder` as the
third and fourth argument respectively. By mutating both, the total stays in
sync with the returned values. Note that the result of the `count` event is used
to mutate the `listBuilder` afterwards to only select the results of the current
pagination result.

Another edge case is the `create` event for a nested `oneToOne` relation. It's
third argument is the same builder as used in the `single` routes, for checking
if the relation already the `oneToOne` field.
