# Typescript setup

::: tip

Requires `@compas/cli` to be installed

:::

The recommended way of developing projects with Compas is to use JavaScript with types in
JSDoc. This prevents compilation steps and gives the same auto complete experience as with
Typescript. Some IDE's work better with the Typescript Language Server so we recommend
using a `tsconfig` or `jsconfig`. Compas provides a `jsconfig` via
`compas init --jsconfig`.

Note that the Compas ESLint plugin does not support Typescript files. Use a custom config
with for example `@typescript-eslint` for a better experience.
