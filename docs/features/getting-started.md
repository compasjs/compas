# Getting started

Let's start by checking the system and project requirements;

- Running macOS or any Linux based OS
- Node.js v24 or higher installed
- Yarn or NPM installed
- Using ES Modules by adding `{ type: "module" }` in your package.json

To initialize a new Compas project add the following dependencies:

```shell
npm install @compas/cli @compas/code-gen @compas/server @compas/stdlib @compas/store
```
