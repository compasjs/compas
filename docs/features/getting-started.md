# Getting started

Let's start by checking the system and project requirements;

- Running macOS or any Linux based OS
- Node.js v16 or higher installed
- Yarn or NPM installed
- Using ES Modules by adding `{ type: "module" }` in your package.json

To initialize a new Compas project, execute one of the following command in a new
directory

```shell
# Via NPM
npx create-compas@latest

# Or with Yarn
yarn create compas
```

Run `npx create-compas@latest --help` / `yarn create compas --help` for all the available
options.
