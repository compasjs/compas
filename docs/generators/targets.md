# Code generation targets

Compas code generators are based on a combination of targets. The most important
target is which programming language you want to use: the `targetLanguage`.

```js {6}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
});
```

The supported target languages are:

- `js`: Generate plain JavaScript. This utilizes
  [ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#introduction).
- `ts`: Generates TypeScript files

Each of the below generators has support for one or more of these target
languages. They could combine this with supported target libraries, runtimes or
dialects depending on the generator.

To automatically write the generated files to disk, you can use an
`outputDirectory`. If it is not specified all generated files will be returned.

```js {7}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
  outputDirectory: "./src/generated",
});
```

## Structure

The structure generator dumps the input Compas structure to disk. This is useful
for libraries to expose some types to the user or can be used for post
processing. It ignores all targets.

```js {8}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
  generators: {
    structure: {},
  },
});
```

## Types

The type generator is enabled for all supported target languages. Other
generators will utilize it to write their specific types. There are few options
you can optionally specify

```js {8-11}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
  generators: {
    types: {
      declareGlobalTypes: true,
      includeBaseTypes: true,
    },
  },
});
```

- `declareGlobalTypes`: This wraps all generated types in a `declare global`
  block, skipping the need to import specific types on usage.
- `includeBaseTypes`: By default, only the used types by the other generators
  will be generated. By enabling this option, all known types in the
  specification will be generated. This can be usefull when you utilize Compas
  in libraries.

::: tip

If the `targetLanguage` is set to `js`, TypeScript types will still be
generated. You can use these generated types in combination with the TypeScript
language server to improve auto completion. See
[Types in JS](https://github.com/voxpelli/types-in-js) for tips and tricks.

## Validators

Like the type generator, the validator generator also always enabled for all
supported target languages. Compas generators will inject validators in critical
parts of the generated output to ensure that only structurally correct values
can pass. Preventing wrong data or even over sharing information.

```js {8-10}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
  generators: {
    validators: {
      includeBaseTypes: true,
    },
  },
});
```

- `includeBaseTypes`: By default, only the used types by the other generators
  will get a validator. By enabling this option, all known types in the
  specification will get a generated validator. This can be usefull when you
  utilize Compas in libraries. This value will imply `types.includeBaseTypes`,
  since the validator generator will automatically call the type generator to
  generate the corresponding input and output types.

## API clients

The API client generator provides support to choose your own target library. For
some supported libraries, there is even a need to specify the language runtime.

Supported libraries:

- [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API): This
  standard is supported in combination with the `js` or `ts` target languages.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro): This library is supported in
  combination with the `js` or `ts` target languages.
- ...we are currently thinking about the next target to support. Feel free to
  open an [issue](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/issues/)!

The Axios and Fetch based API clients also need to differentiate between the
supported runtimes. This is necessary to determine if response validation should
be enabled, and to work around compatibilities of different `FormData`
implementations.

```js {8-15}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "ts",
  generators: {
    apiClient: {
      target: {
        library: "fetch",
        targetRuntime: "browser",
        globalClient: true,
        includeWrapper: "react-query",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

- `target.library`: Determine which API library will be used. See above for the
  supported libraries
- `target.targetRuntime`: Specify the runtime which will be used. Accepted
  values are: `node.js`, `browser` and `react-native`. This is only necessary
  for the `axios` and `fetch` targets.
- `target.includeWrapper`: Also generate an API client wrapper to ease
  integration with your UI framework. Supports
  [`react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview) to
  generate React hooks, including auto query invalidations if the structure
  includes them.
- `target.globalClient`: Used by the `axios` and `fetch` targets to generate a
  global `AxiosInstance` or `Fetch`-function. This removes the need to pass the
  client to each generated function. Also supports a global `QueryClient` if the
  `react-query` wrapper is used.
- `responseValidation.looseObjectValidation`: When the `target.targetRuntime` is
  set to `node.js`, the API client responses are automatically validated. This
  defaults to a loose object validation, allowing the response to contain more
  keys than the type suggests. If you use the generated API client for E2E
  testing, you may want to set this option to `false`. This ensures that you
  don't overshare any data, as the validator will error on extra properties in
  your response.

::: warning

Make sure that you don't share state on the global clients in server contexts.
Like when you use the API client in
[Next.js `getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).

## Router

Compas also supports generating an optimized router for the available routes in
the structure. This is supported with the `js` target language. The router will
automatically generate the necessary types and validators for route parameters,
query parameters, request bodies and responses.

It has support for the following target libraries:

- [Koa](https://koajs.com/): Generates a Koa compatible router, passing the
  [Koa Context](https://koajs.com/#context) to your controllers.
- ...we are currently thinking about the next target to support. Feel free to
  open an [issue](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/issues/)!

```js {8-13}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "js",
  generators: {
    router: {
      target: {
        library: "koa",
      },
      exposeApiStructure: true,
    },
  },
});
```

- `target.library`: the library to generate a router for.
- `exposeApiStructure`: adds `/_compas/structure.json` which exposes all the
  available routes and necessary types. This can be used by clients to generate
  a compatible API client.

## OpenAPI

Compas is able to convert its structure to an OpenAPI 3 specification compatible
format. This loses some information like [invalidations](/#todo). It can be used
to generate API clients for targets not supported by Compas.

```js {8-11}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "js",
  generators: {
    openApi: {
      openApiExtensions: {},
      openApiRouteExtensions: {},
    },
  },
});
```

- `openApiExtenstions`: An object to override some root properties in the
  generated OpenAPI specification
- `openApiRouteExtensions`: Add metadata to specific routes. This can be used
  with for example OpenAPI's security schemes, to add specific authentication
  methods to a route.

## Database

The Compas generator can also generate queries for different databases. This is
based on dialects instead of libraries. We are not planning to support different
target libraries for a single dialect per target language.

Supported dialects

- `postgres`: This is supported with the `js` target language via
  [porsager/postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres) package.

```js {8-11}
import { Generator } from "@compas/code-gen/experimental";

const generator = new Generator();

generator.generate({
  targetLanguage: "js",
  generators: {
    database: {
      target: {
        dialect: "postgres",
        includeDDL: true,
      },
      includeEntityDiagram: true,
    },
  },
});
```

- `target.dialect`: the dialect that will be used
- `target.includeDDL`: include example DDL output to facilitate writing
  migration files.
- `includeEntityDiagram`: Generate an entity diagram. This is done via
  [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and written in a markdown file in to the
  `common` directory.
