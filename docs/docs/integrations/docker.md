# Docker integration

Most of the time your application requires external services. Compas supports
automatically spinning up those external services via [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

## Getting started

The docker integration is not enabled by default. You can run the following command or
apply the config changes below manually.

```shell
compas init docker
```

This creates or updates the Compas config file in `config/compas.json` with the following
contents:

```json
{
	"dockerContainers": {
		"compas-postgres-15": {
			"image": "postgres:15",
			"createArguments": "-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata -v compas-postgres-15:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata -p 5432:5432",
			"runArguments": ""
		}
	}
}
```

## Config

Each container definition has the following properties:

- The image name, in the above example 'compas-postgres-15'. This name should either be
  unique over all your projects, or the container is reused across projects that specify
  the same name. This may be the desired behavior if you work on multiple projects that
  share the same set of services.
- `createArguments`: Arguments to pass to the `docker create` command. See the
  [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/) for
  more information. The `--name` argument and image are provided by Compas.
- `image`: The image to create the container from. Anything that Docker supports works. It
  is advised to develop against the same versions as your production environment will
  have.

## Limitations

- Compas only evaluates the state of the Docker containers on startup and on configuration
  changes.
- Compas automatically stops all containers that are not required for the current project.
  However, once the development environment exits, the containers will be kept running.
- Compas assumes that containers with the same name are compatible across projects. Make
  sure to use unique names when that is not the case.
- Compas does not detect changes to the `image`, `createArguments` or `runArguments`.
  Manually remove the container with `docker container rm $name` to let Compas recreate
  the container.
