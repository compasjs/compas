# Actions and defaults

Compas will do a few things automatically for you when it is running. These are called
integrations. Some of them only run once configured. Others are enabled by default.

By default, Compas will watch your package.json files and determine if it needs to
reinstall your dependencies. This way your local environment always matches the required
dependency versions.

## Configuration

Compas is configurable via a JSON file at `config/compas.json`. An empty config file is
automatically created in your project when you run Compas. In this config file, you can
configure custom actions. These actions will be available when Compas is running and can
be executed via the configured shortcuts.

```json
{
	"actions": [
		{
			"name": "Lint",
			"shortcut": "L",
			"command": ["npm", "run", "lint"]
		}
	]
}
```

Now when you press 'L' when Compas is running, it will run the defined command and return
back to the menu. When a process is running, you can restart it with 'R' or kill the
running process by pressing 'K'.

The configuration file is automatically reloaded on changes, assuming that the syntax is
correct. Allowing you to iterate on it and expand your [workspace](/docs/workspaces.html).

## Inferred actions

Compas tries to give you a good experience without any configuration. This is why Compas
automatically infers some standard actions based on your project setup.

These inferred actions are only added when no action with the same or similar name is
defined. For example, 'Lint' is only added if both 'Lint' and 'Format' are not configured.

- 'Dev' is automatically populated from the package.json scripts.
- 'Lint' defaults to the 'format' script defined in your package.json OR the 'lint' script
  defined in your package.json OR to `compas lint` if the `@compas/cli` package is
  installed.
- 'Test' is based on the 'test' script in your package.json OR to `compas test` if the
  `@compas/cli` package is installed.

## Other integrations

Compas supports much more. Like automatically starting Docker containers for services that
your development environment needs, or running the code generators automatically on
changes (not yet implemented). For more information, checkout the
[integrations](/docs/integrations/docker.md).
