# Workspaces

Compas comes with out-of-the-box support for workspaces. All
[actions and defaults](/docs/actions-and-defaults.html) from the previous chapter are
executed for the known projects in a workspace. Allowing you to run Compas once and get
the benefits for all projects that you are working on simultaneously.

## Enabling workspaces

The configuration file `config/compas.json` allows you to define related projects, for
example:

```json [config/compas.json]
{
	"projects": ["packages/shared"]
}
```

This registers a sub project in `$root/packages/shared`. All automatic actions that Compas
executes are now also done relative to that directory. You can create another config in
`$root/packages/shared/config/compas.json` to define custom actions for that specific
project and to add even more nested projects.

Navigation to subprojects is automatically added:

Compas also allows projects to be in a sibling directory:

```json [config/compas.json]
{
	"projects": ["../project-frontend"]
}
```

In this case, the sibling directory is optional and not loaded if it can not be found. It
is also allowed to create recursive project references, so you can set up Compas in all
individual projects, and it automatically includes the other projects when they are found.
Giving the same experience no matter which project you are currently working on.

## Limitations

- Compas assumes that nested projects are also setup correctly in your package manager and
  only runs installation (e.g `npm install`) in the root project. For sibling projects,
  Compas runs the inferred package manager in each project.
- Compas stores its cache in the project that you started Compas in and removes the cache
  from referenced projects. This way Compas has a single source of truth. So the most
  efficient way of developing is to always start Compas from the same project and to
  navigate inside Compas to other projects when necessary.
- Only 9 subprojects are supported currently.
