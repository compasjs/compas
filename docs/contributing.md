# CONTRIBUTING

### Development & scripts

Development should be pretty straight forward. Run `yarn lbu test --watch` to
run the test suite. Before making a commit, make sure to run `yarn lbu lint`.
Note that this automatically will try to fix most issues that popup. All
commands in this repo can be run vai the 'self-hosted' `@lbu/cli`. Run
`yarn lbu help` for an overview. Below a few commands related to things you
could be working on:

**General**:

```
# Format with ESLint & Prettier
yarn lbu lint (--watch)
# Run the tests
yarn lbu test (--watch)
# Run coverage test
yarn lbu coverage -- --check-coverage
yarn lbu coverage -- report --reporter lcov
# Link your local lbu checkout to another project
yarn lbu link && yarn lbu linkExternally ../other-project/
```

**Documentation & Typescript types**:

```
# Build docs from index.d.ts files and put in /docs/api.md
yarn lbu typedoc
# Sync content of README.md's based on the README.md in the root
yarn lbu syncMetadata
# Sync assets/examples to the documentation files
yarn lbu syncDocExamples
```

**Code generation, @lbu/store structure changes**:

```
# Generate to ignored files for testing stuff out
yarn lbu generate
# Generate for @lbu/ packages
yarn lbu internal_generate
```

### Debugging tests

Debug that file as if you debug whatever other Node.js script. E.g in Webstorm:
(right-mouse click -> Debug `file.test.js`)

### Publishing

- Ensure you are logged in to npm with `npm whoami`, when logged out;
  `npm login`
- Ensure you have master checked out, and are completely up-to-date
- Write to the changelog
  - Run `yarn lbu changelog`
  - Change the version and fix link to tag
  - New features
  - Breaking changes
- Commit with `*: prepare release for vX.X.X` and push to master
- Run `yarn release`. This will build & publish all packages
  - Specify the new version
  - Check packages it will publish and send `y`
  - Give a new OTP every time it is asked.
