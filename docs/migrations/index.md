# Migrations

Migration changes of packages are provided in the changelog entry or release
notes of a package. To start using a package you need to migrate to the current
running state, the easiest way to do this is to create a new migration file with
the final contents as provided. Make sure to keep track of new migrations, so
you don't get confusing errors.
