# With Auth Compas template

This project is created using the
[with-auth](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/tree/main/examples/with-auth)
template via [create-compas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-compas).

```shell
# Via NPM
npx create-compas@latest --template with-auth

# Or with Yarn
yarn create compas --template with-auth
```

## Getting started

- Start up the development Postgres and Minio instances
  - `compas docker up`
- Apply the Postgres migrations
  - `compas migrate`
- Regenerate router, validators, types, sql, etc.
  - `compas generate` / `compas generate application`
- Run the tests
  - `compas test --serial`

## Structure and features

This project is structured according to the
[default Compas template](https://github.com/compasjs/compas/tree/main/examples/default).

- Uses `@compas/eslint-plugin` with `compas lint` for running ESLint and
  Prettier
- Has code generation based on `@compas/code-gen`, with the definitions stored
  in `gen/*` and a custom command in `commands/generate.js`
- Contains 'global' services via
  [ES Module live bindings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57552682) in
  `services/core.js`.
- Entrypoint for both starting the api via `compas run api` /
  `node ./scripts/api.js` and a background queue via `compas run queue` /
  `node ./scripts/queue.js`.
- Tests running on a temporary Postgres database, temporary S3 bucket and
  validating responses.

## Auth

This project is created with support for sessions provided by
[@compas/store](https://compasjs.com/features/session-handling.html). It is a
minimal setup where someone can register with email and password, is able to
login, logout and get information about when they have registered. The
`userHandlers.me` implementation uses `userResolveSession` which you can use in
your own routes. The other provided routes use the session-store and
session-transport functions from Compas to manage session creation, extension
and removal.

There is no logic included for email validation, password reset flows or
removing the user.
