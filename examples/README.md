# Compas examples

Note that these examples should be self-contained and show a single feature or
integration possible via Compas. Explaining in the README what locations to
check for that specific example. Examples should have a `tag` defined in the
package.json, which is used to group them when generating the docs page.

Examples are also tested, see `examples/code-gen-basics/test/example.test.js`
for the minimal test case.
