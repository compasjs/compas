/**
 * The queue system is based on 'static' units of work to be done in the background.
 * It supports the following:
 * - Job priority's. Lower value means higher priority.
 * - Scheduling jobs at a set time
 * - Customizable handler timeouts
 * - Recurring job handling
 * - Concurrent workers pulling from the same queue
 * - Specific workers for a specific job
 *
 * When to use which function of adding a job:
 * - {@link queueWorkerAddJob}: use the queue as background processing of defined units.
 * Like converting a file to different formats, sending async or scheduled notifications.
 * Jobs created will have a priority of '5'.
 * - {@link queueWorkerRegisterCronJobs}: use the queue for scheduled recurring jobs
 * based on the specific `cronExpression`. Jos created will have a default priority of
 * '4'.
 *
 * Every job runs with a timeout. It is determined in the following order:
 * - Timeout of the specific job, via `handlerTimeout` property. Should be used
 * sporadically
 * - Timeout of a specific handler as provided by the `handler` property.
 * - The `handlerTimeout` property of the QueueWorker
 *
 * Jobs are picked up if the following criteria are met:
 * - The job is not complete yet
 * - The job's 'scheduledAt' property is in the past
 * - The job's 'retryCount' value is lower than the `maxRetryCount` option.
 *
 * Eligible jobs are sorted in the following order:
 * - By priority ascending, so a lower priority value job will run first
 * - By scheduledAt ascending, so an earlier scheduled job will be picked before a later
 * scheduled job.
 *
 * If a job fails, by throwing an error, other jobs may run first before
 * any retries happen, based on the above ordering.
